Don't worry, Danny, every blatantly violent and abusive posting made by 
Hamzah is immediately forwarded to the operator of the system in which he 
has an account.  I'd imagine they have quite a file started on this 
fruitcake--and have already indicated that they have rules governing 
racist and threatening use of their resources.  I'd imagine he'll be out 
of our hair in a short while.

Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure
they deserve and MVP ("can't win without him").  However, I'd suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for
the All-Star game notwithstanding.

As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his "breakthrough" year (for him) last year, so he didn't
really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on
the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent
numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league
oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.
I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.

As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or
even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

At least Motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies...

Subject: Some questions regarding Big Brother (Clipper)


     In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was
reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in
64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be
derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message".
     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted
with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part
message is then encrypted by still another key.
     My question is: What is a message?
     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.
This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure
communications link.
     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to
each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session?
     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?
Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?
     Any ideas?

Actually, there was very little to the book.  First of all looking at
the titles of her other books, I would personally consider her 
to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticism
heavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like 
_The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_).

However, other than the Chapter One into, there's nothing original,
biased, or even new this book.  It is basically a collection of previously
published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu
stories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa) 
during the period from late teens to age 30.

Conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting
a summary of various published works and letters, all of which you
could verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works as
well.  Therefore, even if you think she is theologically warped, this 
book is a nice reference summary for the interested.

Subject: Rayshade query

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade 4.00. I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade. Unfortunately I still have to do the knight (horse). Any ideas?
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. The board is marble.
Unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces?

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command. Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and I don't have
Craig Kolb's email address. Anybody with ideas, because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing.

Where should I post the finished chessboard?

Is there anybody else using rayshade on non-Unix systems?

How fast does Unix render?

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no
artistic talent.

Back when I was building round tail light 2002s they were Bimmers.  It was

Attendance in 1992 was down. By .3%. From an all-time record in 1991.
In people terms, attendance was down by 310,000 from 1991 to 1992. Two
franchises, the Dodgers and Mets, were down by 1,100,000 from 1991 to 1992.
Had either of them not been entirely awful, MLB would have set another
attendance record in 1992.

FORTRAN, "the infantile disorder", by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly
inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today:  it is
now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.
